# Robot-Arm-Bracket-3D-Printed-Part

This project includes the 3D design and printing settings for a custom **robot arm bracket**. The part is designed to hold a servo motor or joint securely and is optimized for mechanical strength and clean surface quality.

# Part Description

- **Type:** U-shaped bracket for robot arm
- **Mounting Holes:**
  - 2 side holes (for servo shaft and screws)
  - 4 bottom hexagonal holes (for bolts/nuts)
- **Material:** PETG 
- **Designed For:** Robot joint or motor mount

# Material Recommendation
PETG : is a strong and slightly flexible material that offers excellent layer adhesion. It is resistant to impact and mechanical stress, making it ideal for functional parts. Unlike ABS, it doesn’t warp much during printing and is generally easier to work with, especially on open-frame printers. PETG is chosen for this project because it offers the best balance of strength, flexibility, and ease of printing — ideal for mechanical components like robot arm joints.

I only changed the layer height to 0.1 mm; all other settings remain at their default values.

I only changed the sparse infill density to 40%; all other settings are left at their default values.
